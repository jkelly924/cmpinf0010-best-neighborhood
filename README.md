# Best Neighborhood
This is a project to identify the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh using publicly available datasets. This was created for CMPINF 0010.

## Group: "The Answer to Life, The Universe, and Everything"
Canvas Number: 42

We are measuring this using three submetrics: **Fire Rates**, **Crime Rates**, and **Total Area**. The data sets used are:
- [Fire Incidents in City of Pittsburgh](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/fire-incidents-in-city-of-pittsburgh) (For Fire Rates)
  - A dataset containing the number of reported fires in each neighborhood of Pittsburgh.
- [Neighborhoods with SNAP Data](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/neighborhoods-with-snap-data) (For Crime Rates)
  - A dataset containing tons of information about Pittsburgh including population statistics, land area, etc. In this project, we used the subset of the data about crimes. It contained information about not only overall number, but type of crime sorted by the neighborhood in which it occured.
- [Neighborhoods](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/neighborhoods2) (For Total Area)
  - A dataset containing information about neighborhoods. In this project, we used the information about land area.
